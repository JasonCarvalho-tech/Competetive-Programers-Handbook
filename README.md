# Competetive Programming

**This is not intended to be a collabarative project I'm just putting my code here, of course issues/PRs ect are welcome if you have something to add**

Trying to learn to be a better programmer through CP.
Though you don't exactly need CP to be a good software engineer, it might help
with your problem solving skills.
